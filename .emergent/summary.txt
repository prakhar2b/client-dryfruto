<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website  under the brand name DryFruto.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core App:** A full-stack web application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- **Branding:** Use the business name DryFruto and slogan Live With Health.
- **Content:** The website should feature specific categories, product types, and a product page with size variants.
- **Functionality:** Instead of a standard checkout, product pages must have WhatsApp and Call buttons.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive admin panel is required to manage all website content, including UI elements, products, and site settings.
- **Feature Enhancements (from previous sessions):**
    - Make contact info (WhatsApp, Email, Address) and social media links configurable.
    - Implement local file uploads for images.
    - Allow setting custom prices for each product size variant.
    - Add Bulk Order, Career, and About Us pages.
    - Create a Submissions section in the admin panel to track and export form data.
- **Feature Enhancements (this session):**
    - Make the Bulk Order page content (product types, benefits) configurable.
    - Make the About Us page content configurable (Partially implemented).
    - Display the SKU on the product detail page.
    - Implement and subsequently remove a theme/CSS customizer from the admin panel.
    - Change the website's color scheme to a hardcoded Light Pastel Green.
    - Create deployment files for Hostinger VPS (both manual scripts and Docker Compose), with both sets later being removed and then a final Docker Compose setup being created.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) with a complete admin panel for content management. The application's UI has been changed to a hardcoded Light Pastel Green theme at the user's request. The last action was creating a full set of Docker files (, , , , etc.) designed for deployment on Hostinger's Docker Manager using a GitHub repository URL.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested files to support deployment on Hostinger docker manager compose from GitHub url. The agent created , , , , , a  file, and a  with instructions.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Files created but not tested or verified by the user).
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing. The next agent should review the generated Docker files for correctness and then guide the user on how to test them in their Hostinger environment. Building the images locally () would be a good first verification step.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** Verify and Finalize Docker Deployment Setup.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** N/A. The files have just been created.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Review the contents of , , , and  for correctness.
        2.  Ensure the  correctly proxies  and  requests and serves the React build.
        3.  Ensure the Dockerfiles use  to avoid dependency conflicts that occurred earlier.
        4.  Attempt a local build using  to catch any immediate errors.
        5.  Confirm with the user that this setup aligns with Hostinger's Docker Manager requirements.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To provide the user with a working, one-click deployment solution for their Hostinger VPS as requested.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (User has requested multiple different deployment solutions).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (via deployment).
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1 (P1):** Complete About Us Page Configuration in Admin Panel.
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent created  and added a link to the admin sidebar. However, the user interrupted with a request for a theming engine. The  component is likely a skeleton and needs to be fully implemented with input fields for all the content on the About Us page (story, vision, mission, stats, etc.). The backend model ( in ) was updated to include fields like ,  etc., so the backend is ready.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The user will be able to manage the content of the About Us page dynamically from the admin panel, which was an explicit request.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on something:** Blocked by user's focus on deployment. Should be re-proposed after deployment is sorted.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   None. The user has not requested any new features beyond completing the About Us configuration and sorting out deployment.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Bulk Order Page:** Fixed button alignment and made page content (product types, benefits) configurable via the admin panel.
-   **Product Page:** Added SKU display below the product description.
-   **Color Scheme:** Replaced the entire website and admin panel's dynamic theme with a hardcoded Light Pastel Green color scheme.
-   **Admin Panel Bug Fix:** Resolved a 422 Unprocessable Entity error that prevented saving changes in the Settings and About Us tabs by correcting a Pydantic model mismatch ( vs ).
-   **Feature Reversions (User-requested):**
    -   Implemented and subsequently **removed** a comprehensive CSS/Theme Customizer from the admin panel.
    -   Implemented and subsequently **removed** all manual deployment scripts (, , etc.).
    -   Implemented and subsequently **reverted** a change that forced WhatsApp links to use the phone number field.
-   **Dependency Fix:** Resolved an npm <command>

-   **Deployment Files:** Created a complete Docker Compose setup for deployment on Hostinger.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete About Us Admin Page**
    -   **Debug checklist:**
        1.  Open .
        2.  Implement UI components (text inputs, text areas, list managers) to edit the fields defined in the  model in  (e.g., , , , , etc.).
        3.  Ensure the component fetches existing data from  and uses the  function to PUT changes to the  endpoint.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This was an explicit user request that was started but never finished. Completing it will make the About Us page fully manageable by the admin.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Both.
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Dockerized Deployment:** The current architecture is designed for a multi-container Docker deployment managed by Docker Compose. It includes separate services for the backend, a static Nginx server for the frontend, and relies on an external MongoDB instance.
-   **Multi-Stage Frontend Build:**  uses a multi-stage build to compile the React app and then copies only the static  artifacts into a lean final image, which is then used by the Nginx container.
-   **Hardcoded Theming:** The Light Pastel Green theme is implemented via direct TailwindCSS class changes in JSX components and updates to . This is a deliberate move away from the previously attempted dynamic CSS customizer.

**key DB schema**
-   **site_settings:** A singleton document that now includes fields for the About Us page (e.g., , , ) and Bulk Order page (, ).

**changes in tech stack**
-   Deployment strategy has pivoted multiple times, finally settling on a Docker Compose setup tailored for Hostinger.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services (backend, frontend, proxy) for deployment.
-   **/app/Dockerfile.frontend**: Key file for building the React app in a Docker environment.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/AboutUsManager.jsx**: The incomplete component for managing About Us content.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/layout/Header.jsx**: Modified to use hardcoded pastel green colors.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/layout/Footer.jsx**: Modified to use hardcoded pastel green colors.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Contains updated  model for About Us and Bulk Order pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The hardcoded color classes are spread across dozens of components. While this was a direct result of a user request to remove the CSS customizer, it makes future theme changes difficult. This isn't a bug, but a point of technical debt to be aware of.
-   The backend model in  may contain unused fields from the reverted Theme/CSS features. A quick audit to remove fields like  or  from the  Pydantic models would be beneficial if they still exist.

**key api endpoints**
-   : (GET, PUT) The primary endpoint for managing all global site configuration, including the new About Us and Bulk Order content.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User Behavior:** The user frequently requests large features (Theming, CSS Customizer, Deployment Scripts) and then asks to have them completely removed. **Confirm large-scale changes thoroughly before implementation.** Propose smaller, incremental steps.
-   **Current Priority is Deployment:** The user's immediate goal is to get the application running on their Hostinger VPS using the newly created Docker files. Do not switch to other tasks until this is resolved.
-   **Incomplete About Us Feature:** A significant feature (making the About Us page configurable) was started but abandoned. This is the most important pending task after deployment is handled.
-   **Hardcoded Theme is Intentional:** The current Light Pastel Green theme is hardcoded across many files. This is the desired state after the user requested the removal of the dynamic theme manager. Do not try to fix this by re-introducing a dynamic system unless explicitly asked.
